# Contributing to Awesome Psyop

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project thrives on high-quality resources that help people defend against manipulation, misinformation, and cognitive attacks.

## Ground Rules

- **Add only high-quality resources** — no spam, low-quality blogs, or clickbait.
- **Prefer original, open-source, or well-respected tools** whenever possible.
- **Follow the list style** — keep formatting consistent (Title – short description).
- **No heavy self-promotion.** If you built something amazing, that's fine. If it’s purely promotional, it will be rejected.
- **Keep sections organized** — suggest a new category only if necessary.
