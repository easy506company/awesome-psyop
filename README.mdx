# awesome-psyop

A curated arsenal against influence operations, disinformation, and psychological attacks.

---

⚠️ Important:
If you suspect that you are the target of a psyop, remember: you may not always be able to block the signal or change your surroundings. Such operations can trigger intense psychological states, including paranoia, mania, or a extreme fear of death.
It is **critical** to stay in contact with a psychiatrist. Proper treatment can help you manage severe fatigue caused by insomnia and improve your emotional stability and situational awareness.

## Protocols

### ***⚔️ Death Threat Protocol: Power Projection Mode***

When you're targeted with fear-based tactics — especially threats of death, exposure, or "final warnings" — do not absorb the signal. Reflect it. Amplify the opposite.

- Frame Override (mental switch)
“This threat confirms I’m over the target.”

Treat it as an attack vector — not a prophecy. Someone wants submission. Respond with signal dominance.

- Signal Defense Tactics
Posture: Head up. Back straight. Breath calm. Look like someone who writes history, not reads it.

Language override: Replace “what if they...” with “they should’ve stopped me when they had the chance.”

Output: Project unity, confidence, force. No reactivity. No fear speech. No pleading.

> “You want me silent. So I speak louder.”

> “You want me isolated. So I align with others.”

> “You want me scared. So I weaponize clarity.”

- Threat Reversal
Fear is not a message. It’s leverage. Take it from them.

Show productivity under pressure: publish, build, mobilize.

Document everything. Turn observation into exposure.

Make it clear — attacks create momentum, not silence.
